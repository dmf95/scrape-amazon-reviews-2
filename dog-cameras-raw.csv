"Furbo Dog Camera: Treat Tossing, Full HD WiFi Pet Camera and 2-Way Audio, Designed for Dogs, Compatible with Alexa (As Seen On Ellen)","Reviewed in Canada on December 14, 2018",Glorified Webcam,2.0,"I bought the Furbo as a birthday gift for my boyfriend who is absolutely obsessed with his dog. I figured we were getting a screaming deal since I bought it on Prime Day 2018 for an ""unheard of price"" (according to Furbo) of $199 – $100 off. The price has now fluctuated within a few dollars of $199 since Prime Day in July. I digress. Regardless, we were both super jazzed that we could check in on the pup, talk to him AND toss him a few treats. Now, having had it for a few months, we can honestly say that it wasn't really worth the money – here's why. You might be able to see your pup, but the video quality is quite grainy and on par with a 90's webcam which is largely disappointing. The sound detection of barking is pretty spot on; however, the mic volume is very poor, so my dog can't hear me when I tune in to the Furbo, making it a very impractical feature. We do really enjoy the treat dispenser function (definite plus). Understandably, the treat dispenser is only meant to hold a particular, round treat, so that never bugged me, but I know bugs others who use very specific treats with their pets. Our biggest frustration with the Furbo, however, is the notifications we now have to pay extra for (what Furbo now calls the Dog Nanny). Previously a free feature, notifications like when your dog is being active (or for many of us, when your dog is getting into things s/he shouldn't), now come at a additional monthly subscription fee. Our two cents? Save your money, skip the Furbo and opt for a webcam."
"Furbo Dog Camera: Treat Tossing, Full HD WiFi Pet Camera and 2-Way Audio, Designed for Dogs, Compatible with Alexa (As Seen On Ellen)","Reviewed in Canada on August 15, 2018",Recieved Used Item!,1.0,Extremely disappointed. I recieved a Furbo that clearly is a return. The inside was dirty from it being used and the cables were unwrapped. I paid almost $300 Canadian for a brand new product only to recieved a used one and now I have to go through the hassle of returning it. Do not recommend at all!
"Furbo Dog Camera: Treat Tossing, Full HD WiFi Pet Camera and 2-Way Audio, Designed for Dogs, Compatible with Alexa (As Seen On Ellen)","Reviewed in Canada on May 26, 2018",Furbo made miracle happen for me,5.0,"I’ve been using furbo for 2.5 weeks now. It has done so much for me!! I have a maltipoo who has been having to stay at my parents’ place when I moved out because when I tried to keep him at my small apartment, he barks all day long cuz he gets bored out of his mind when I’m at work all day. I couldn’t keep him at my place cuz neighbours started to complain and the strata manager even gave me warnings about how he has to call SPCA if it continues. It took my baby about a week to adjust to furbo. He was barking at it everytime I tried to interact with him through it in the first week. I only gave him treats through furbo when I see that he is quiet and has calmed down. The next week he was surprisingly adjusting to it very well, barely barked and I could talk to him through furbo and give him treats without him barking at all! I was so proud of him!! Hopefully in the next weeks to come he will continue to behave and I can continue to keep him at my place with the help of furbo!The only small issue I had with furbo was the time on the screen was incorrect even though I had selected the right time zone (which was resolved really quickly with great customer service by email). Just for your information, the treat dispenser always dispenses 2-3 treats at a time instead of just one which I wasn’t expecting. I bought one of the recommended treats on their site which was Dog for Dog mini treats. Another thing is be careful where you aim the treats, they don’t always shoot out into the exact same spot so if it goes under a furniture, your dog will not forget, it will bark at it until the treat grows legs and comes walking out on its own (in the dogs mind) since my apartment is small, I can’t place furbo where ever I want to to avoid it being tossed under furniture. I’ve placed obstructions like cardboard boxes under the furniture to avoid it from rolling in.But regardless, these things are minor to me because what furbo has done for me is so much greater in comparison to them!Because of furbo, I can actually keep my baby with me everyday and see him every time I come home from work!————-— Update —————-I’ve been using furbo for over half a year now and I still recommend the product. I am just updating you in some glitches that I’ve encountered since using furbo.Over the months there has been some updates on furbo’s system and I’ve found that the camera lags more often after the updates so I’ve had to switch to the lowest resolution now and then. Some days, the in and out of the audio is malfunctioning so it will not notify me if my dog was barking. When that happens, if I don’t unplug and replug furbo, it will continue to malfunction. It’s happened to me about 4 times since I’ve had furbo.I have faith that furbo will improve on these things just because of their great customer service and that is why I still recommend furbo :)———————Update————————I’ve been using Furbo for about a year and a half now and I’ve still been recommending this product to people just because of how grateful I am of what furbo has given me. I came across another review that the mic feature is very poor as I was showing a friend of mine this product on amazon. I just want to say I personally think this feature is decent. From time to time I actually talk to my boyfriend and dog at home when I’m out using furbo so quality of the sound is not an issue for us. My dog has never not heard me whenever I called for him on furbo. He always comes running when he hears me on furbo because he thinks he might be getting a treat!Lastly, the furbo “nanny” feature (with bonus features of intruder alert, selfie alert and your dog being active alert etc) has always been a bonus feature. There was a period in time when everyone got a free trial of the furbo nanny and had a choice if they wanted to proceed with paying monthly for the special features. I simply ignored it and they’re not charging me any fees for it. I am happy with their barking alert, mic and treat toss features."
"Furbo Dog Camera: Treat Tossing, Full HD WiFi Pet Camera and 2-Way Audio, Designed for Dogs, Compatible with Alexa (As Seen On Ellen)","Reviewed in Canada on November 28, 2018","I paid for a cool concept, not a functional product",1.0,"I had REALLY high hopes for this product since the concept seemed to be interesting and useful. When setting it up it took a few tries for it to start connected to our wifi, which isn't a big deal on it's own, trying to use it for a few days on the other hand just adds to the frustration of the product. The concept of paying for the nanny aspect in the future is baffling to me, since the product retails for $299. The camera quality is bad even in good lighting, the live stream is very choppy, delayed, and the app keeps telling me to low the video quality from 720p--- my internet is more than qualified to handle this product. The app either glitches and closes or just flat out refuses to play any 10 sec clips to sends me a notification for. Half of my attempted uses involve the app not even allowing me to view in real time due to an error that closing completely, restarting or uninstalling/reinstalling doesn't fix.When it does 'work' and I get to view my dogs being 'active', it's never when he gets up or plays, its always as hes jumping back onto the sofa to lay down. Last night I had 15 notifications/10 sec clips of my one dog laying down... out of 4 animals that are always in that one room that's all it captured? Hardly worth hundreds of dollars.I'm not sure how anyone could endorse such a pricey product knowing it could be 90% better."
"Furbo Dog Camera: Treat Tossing, Full HD WiFi Pet Camera and 2-Way Audio, Designed for Dogs, Compatible with Alexa (As Seen On Ellen)","Reviewed in Canada on December 10, 2017","5/5 Super fun, amazing dog camera",5.0,"Amazing purchase!! I love being able to check in on my dog and cat when I'm not home, and they love getting treats when we're not home. The set up was super easy and I had no issues connecting to the Furbo my wifi or to the app on my phone (total process took 5-10 minutes), and the power cord is quite long which is super useful if you want to place the Furbo somewhere that isn't right beside an outlet. I used training treats for the Furbo that I had at home (I think most training treats would work as they tend to be smaller) and it's super fun. He got more treats than usual the first night because it was so much fun tossing the treats and seeing him wait by the Furbo. I'm going to have to ease up on this, lest he becomes too chunky...I've attached some pictures during the day and at night and as you can see, the video quality is great. So far the cat hasn't been quick enough to get any treats since the dog is so fast (sidenote: the only time the dog is fast is when food is involved), but maybe one day... All in all, 5/5 stars!"
"Furbo Dog Camera: Treat Tossing, Full HD WiFi Pet Camera and 2-Way Audio, Designed for Dogs, Compatible with Alexa (As Seen On Ellen)","Reviewed in Canada on January 18, 2019",There are better alternatives!,1.0,"The Furbo definitely works, but not well. The camera quality is great but the the real kicker is that you can’t use it. When the camera is on the highest quality setting the “live” footage is trash, it’s super choppy. The only way to get fluent footage is for the Furbo to be on the lowest camera quality setting.I could almost stand by this product if it wasn’t for the price, 300$ is ridiculous. A way better alternative to this is an app called “cloud baby monitor” which is roughly 6$ and is a one time purchase and has no hidden fees (this app is intended to be used on babies but works for this purpose). I open the app on my iPad and leave it at home with the dog and open the app on my iPhone wherever I happen to be and watch him. Sure the app can’t lauch treats at your dog, save footage or has nightvision but if you leave the a light on and leave your dog with a Kong here is no difference. Also on the app you can get sent noise and motion alterts and choose the sensitivity, this replaces bark alterts. The app also has two way talk and can play lullabies."
"Furbo Dog Camera: Treat Tossing, Full HD WiFi Pet Camera and 2-Way Audio, Designed for Dogs, Compatible with Alexa (As Seen On Ellen)","Reviewed in Canada on December 24, 2017",One of the best products I own,5.0,"Excellent camera. Works great as a security camera as well. When dog starts barking you can log in and see what is going on. Reading other reviews..it did take about 4 or 5 times in row typing in my wifi password for the app to connect with furbo for initial setup. Wasn't a big deal. Have patience it is a signal trying to connect.Note: If you have a smart dog, mine learned in 2 days.....if I bark nonstop, this thing will shoot out treats for me. I had to switch my thinking and give my GSP treats when he is relaxed and calm. Lol.Ps. Hilarious part is the kids know we will get alerts on our phones. It sets off the senor notification if you leave it turned on when you are home. We chose to let the kids think it is on all the time. No brothers arguing and yelling in the house now. Bahaha."
"Furbo Dog Camera: Treat Tossing, Full HD WiFi Pet Camera and 2-Way Audio, Designed for Dogs, Compatible with Alexa (As Seen On Ellen)","Reviewed in Canada on April 11, 2019",Great untill the Trial runs out!,1.0,Paid almost $300.00 for the Furbo when it first came out. They have now changed it to a very expensive monthly payment system to keep most of the features operating.Would not have bought had I known.
"Furbo Dog Camera: Treat Tossing, Full HD WiFi Pet Camera and 2-Way Audio, Designed for Dogs, Compatible with Alexa (As Seen On Ellen)","Reviewed in Canada on October 25, 2017",Helps with Separation Anxiety,5.0,"My dog has a bit of separation anxiety and would howl throughout the day.  With this, I get a notification that she's barking, I can throw her a treat and talk to her.  Whether or not she knows it's me, it does break the panic and then she settles back down.  It's a great peace of mind for me.  I had some problems at first with lag but I had placed it where I didn't have good wifi.  Once I fixed that, the streaming works great.  I really like this product.  It was easy to set up and works well."
"Furbo Dog Camera: Treat Tossing, Full HD WiFi Pet Camera and 2-Way Audio, Designed for Dogs, Compatible with Alexa (As Seen On Ellen)","Reviewed in Canada on September 6, 2019",Useless unless you pay monthly,1.0,"Without the monthly subscription camera isn’t good at all. It only allows your to see certain activities that you dog did instead allowing the access to the full daily footage. And it only records those activities for about 15 seconds. So when my dog destroyed half of my living room, I got to see only 15 seconds of it. I just found it very disappointing that a product this expensive would provide such low productivity (unless you want to pay more monthly). Definitely returning this."
"Furbo Dog Camera: Treat Tossing, Full HD WiFi Pet Camera and 2-Way Audio, Designed for Dogs, Compatible with Alexa (As Seen On Ellen)","Reviewed in Canada on October 3, 2018",Horrible,1.0,"Dog nanny part is useless. Doesn’t register my dog walker when she comes in. Even when she deliberately stands in front of it. She calls me so I can check the camera to prove she’s been there because we questioned it when the app wasn’t registering her presence.  It notifies me well after my dogs stops barking (I know as I’m in the house at the time). As a camera to log into and check on dog it’s great. Pictures good. Sounds good. Night visions good.  If you have a dog with separation anxiety like I do, and want  to be notified so you can check on them or talk them down from a freak out, don’t bother with this camera. When I asked customer service for help all the did was repeatedly ask me to log in and back out if the app and restart the camera."

Now with this amazing gadget you can even send your furry friend a treat, this product is amazing I am so happy to be able to see and talk to my dog :)At first my dog barked at it but after a few treats it's like he hit the jackpot and catches the treat mid air."
"Furbo Dog Camera: Treat Tossing, Full HD WiFi Pet Camera and 2-Way Audio, Designed for Dogs, Compatible with Alexa (As Seen On Ellen)","Reviewed in Canada on February 3, 2019","Beware of ""unknown"" subscription fee and inability to delete video",3.0,"I love the unit, which is certainly expensive enough.  Two issues: be prepared for a monthly subscription fee to use the motion detection, which the unit is basically useless without, and video cannot be deleted by the user (stored in Furbo's cloud). If the camera happens to catch you walking around naked, for example, you can't delete the video. It'll stick around in the ""doggy diary"" for a week!!The premium subscription fee has not yet been finalized so it's free for 90 days... After that time, which is conveniently after the return date (!!), the fee will be charged... But we don't know how much it'll be.  They think between $5-10/month.  It is NOT worth $300 plus $120/year."

Even with the free shipping option it arrived very quickly. It was very easy to set up, my girlfriend's mom was able to set it up very quickly and get it going. The phone app paired quickly with the Furbo and they were able to use it right away. The audio was loud and clear and the dogs started paying attention to it once there were sounds. It's only been a few days, but overall the device looks good and it's been working well so far."

It looked like it was just “repackaged.”I just realized that it has been already used because when I tried connecting the Furbo to my device, it said that the Furbo item is already connected to a different device.I paid for almost 300 CAD dollars for a used item.Im really really disappointed, I just hope I can get my money back or atleast get this resolved without any hassle.I was really expecting so much.."

It's such a life savior, I can do everything Furbo promises! ONE SUGGESTION however, I'd LOVE to be able to pre-record messages and send them on command. When I'm at work and I see that my dog is barking, it's hard to start talking to him, so if I can send him recordings by pressing a button, that'd be AMAZING! Thank you for such a well-made product.

Living in an apartment I had to try to change that behavior. Unfortunately, the Furbo had zero effect on my dogs barking. My dog likes getting food throughout the day, but that's about it. My dog is smart enough to understand that even though he is hearing my voice and getting food, i'm not actually there. The positives about this is that while I'm out and about I know that he has something to keep him a little busy and I like knowing what he up to so I'm less worried about him. The device does what it says (gives treats ect.), but has it's limitations and has no affect on my dogs separation anxiety, i'v had it for 2 months now."

It's a waste of money.- First of all, it's 200$ upfront but then none of the features advertised are free - they want you to get a subscription.- Second, the camera quality is horrid, and worse than those cheap IP cameras you can get for under 20$ (you can at least remotely rotate those cameras).- Lastly, It doesn't toss treats very well, even though I'm using the treats they recommend.So what does Furbo do successfully? Nothing.Use that 200$ on better food for your dog or pay a more important bill with it, and get a 20$ camera on Amazon to see your dog when you're out, but I truly hope you don't spend it on this."
"Furbo Dog Camera: Treat Tossing, Full HD WiFi Pet Camera and 2-Way Audio, Designed for Dogs, Compatible with Alexa (As Seen On Ellen)","Reviewed in Canada on October 15, 2019",Cheap build and malfunctions quickly,1.0,"Bought the Furbo only 2 months ago and it worked for the first month and now no longer gives us barking alerts (which are still set to on) and has a habit of refusing to connect so that we can check on the dogs while out. Before you say it’s a network issue, all of our other smart home devices still connect. The sole reason we bought the Furbo was because we live in a busy apartment building and wanted to ensure our dogs aren’t barking when we are out — it has literally stopped providing any sort of assistance with that. It appears to be cheaply built as well."
"Furbo Dog Camera: Treat Tossing, Full HD WiFi Pet Camera and 2-Way Audio, Designed for Dogs, Compatible with Alexa (As Seen On Ellen)","Reviewed in Canada on December 29, 2017","Works easily, great images...",5.0,"I love this! I love seeing what my dog is doing! There's nothing about this camera I would change... Set-up and the app are easy, the quality of the camera images is wonderful (being able to zoom in is a bonus), talking and being able to toss a treat is great... It's heavy enough to be stable on a surface, and it looks good sitting out...I like that you can change the quality of the video (360p,720p,1080p), that there are options for night vision (on, off, automatic), and that you can choose if you want to be notified when your dog barks... There's a Smart Dog Alert option that's free right now (they don't say when that will stop or how much it will be), that will alert you when it detects a person, detects your dog being active, and will take a 'selfie' when your dog looks into the camera... I didn't find those feature particularly useful or interesting - dog activating is probably the best of the three, and am happy with the camera without them..."

I cannot describe how much I love this thing. I work very long days and I worry a lot about my two little puppies, especially as one has pretty good separation anxiety and howls like crazy when I leave. I love being able to get notifications when my little guys are kicking up a fuss and being able to do something about it right away. I was feeling pretty helpless wondering if they were annoying the neighbors etc. With Furbo I can correct their barking right away and help them feel less anxious. It’s a huge load off my mind!Video quality is good. I love being able to take screen shots and videos of what my babies get up to. I love that I can switch to night time mode. The treat dispenser works pretty reliably. I did jam it with treat dust once, but that was my fault since they tell you not to use those sorts of crumbly treats. I got it working again in a few minutes though. Seriously, watching this thing spit treats out on the camera is so funny. Sound on the mic is good, notifications work reliably. I’ve been using it pretty heavily since I got it a few days ago and no problems so far.Will update if something happens since no one wants to drop a bunch of money on something that breaks right away."

I really regret buying this because I could have bought three cameras, each with the ability to rotate and view more of the house for the price of just one Furbo. This offers nothing that much cheaper cameras do. If your dog NEVER moves, then maybe this is worth it. But my dogs never cared when the treats were tossed, the sound it makes when it throws treats is this horrible grinding whirring sound that scares one of my dogs. It’s a huge waste of money."

Treat tossing did not work with a full (to the indicator) hopper so we had to remove treats to the half way mark. Unless you use the specified round treats it launches the food half away across the room rather than ""toss"" in front of the unit. Additionally you have to pay for a subscription for any playback/recording capabilities... Overall for such an expensive unit it was a disappointing purchase that I returned. An amazon camera and Alexa controlled wall plug controlling a food dispenser are less expensive and superior solution."

I really wanted to love this product, but I have to say that the experience is not really good. First, the video quality is below my expectation. If I switch to the highest quality, then I will no longer have smooth video streaming, and it come with annoying buffering. The video is only watchable when the camera quality is on “lowest.” Second, the performance of microphone is unacceptable. My dog can barely hear me when he is not close enough to Furbo. I also tested serval times and I can say the microphone is not have any functional at all. Third, I do not think the product deserve their users to pay for their monthly subscription fee.

I had issues with my first Furbo that arrived - the lid broke after 3 days and sometimes the treats wouldn't dispense (It wouldn't work to throw it or even to get a treat). I called Furbo about it and they sent a replacement right away, so that's good.I always have issues with the app. It always crashes and I have to restart it at least 2-3 times in order for it to load the camera. It's really frustrating when I get a notification of my dog barking (I got noise complaints from neighbours), and it takes me 5-10 minutes of restarting the app several times in order for my Furbo camera to connect. Also, the app crashes frequently.The description also advertises about motion alerts. My dog or cat can be running around like crazy in my home, but I don't get any notification of action. Furthermore, it also doesn't alert you of any movement caused by someone walking by it - I have a dog sitter come by and she walks right by my Furbo and spends some time inside my home... I don't get any kind of notification! Camera quality is mediocre, nothing amazing.I only got the Furbo because of the barking alert which I needed, due to noise complaints. Aside from that, sometimes the treats don't throw properly, app is always crashing, other alerts like motion don't work, etc... And this is from my first and second Furbo.A lot of money for this thing when it doesn't do half of its duties."

Our Bernese mix dog suffers from separation anxiety and unfortunately does not do well being crated. We’ve let her free roam the house but found that she is very destructive towards our furniture and belongings. This camera is truly a godsend for us. I love that we are able to check in on her to see what she’s up to throughout the day and it’s also great that we can speak to her and toss her treats so she doesn’t get too anxious/bored which leads to her destructiveness.The night vision setting is also very handy as well and I feel like it’s a definite bonus to have.Reason I’m only giving it 4 stars is because the app itself absolutely drains my phone battery like no ones business (although this might just be an issue with my phone) and I do have trouble sometimes syncing with the camera when I do pull up the camera on the app - sometimes it takes forever to connect.All in all a great purchase! I’ve recommended this product to all my fellow doggie friends who think it’s so neat that we can watch her in real time and to toss treats to her haha.

We didn't get a sample pack so had to use kibble. I would like to know why we never got the samples? Also, there are no instructions in the box and we had lots of questions which we had to Google which was awkward as there was a lot of updates to download at first and the initial setup was slow and our phones froze alot due to it."

I’m always wondering if he’s happy or sad while I’m away. This FUrbo machine is so amazing! It has reduced a lot of my anxiety about leaving him home alone. I now know that he’s sleeping beside my couch or he’s waiting at the door for me. I also know when someone is at my door or when my friend comes over to play with him. I can check on him at any time. I will advise you though please don’t make the mistake I made. Don’t use the microphone to talk with your pet. My fur baby searched everywhere for me and was crying/ barking for me. He thought I was hiding somewhere at home and it actually really stressed him out. So now I only use this device/ machine/ app to watch and observe how his day is. Also, the treat dispenser completely freaks him out and scares him. It shoots treats across the room which I thought was really cool! My dog runs away and then comes back and growls at it and then hides. So I don’t use that at all. The best things about FUrbo is 1.) I know everything about my dogs day and how much activity he needs when I’m home. 2.) I know if anyone comes over or goes to my back door. 3.) I know if my dog is barking. 4.) it takes really awesome 10 second videos of my dog and his day. I LOVE that! I would buy this again as it was worth every cent!!! I show everyone and tell everyone how it works. If I were rich I would buy one for everyone I know that has a dog. Amazing!!!! The set up was so easy as well! Nothing complicated."

"Furbo Dog Camera: Treat Tossing, Full HD WiFi Pet Camera and 2-Way Audio, Designed for Dogs, Compatible with Alexa (As Seen On Ellen)","Reviewed in Canada on January 9, 2020","Sub-par product, worse service",2.0,"Ok, ive finally gotten frustrated for the last time with this thing and yes i am going to waste 5 minutes of my time writing an angry review because this product has wasted several hours of my time. First things first... Not worth the money they charge, at all. The camera quality is decent, the wifi stream is adequate but sometimes glitchy or laggy (and i have fibe with 50mbps in my home, so i am certain it is not my internet connection). The treat tossing works about 75% of the time, the 25% is when theres a stream interruption which happens alot or the mechanism gets blocked by my treats which are smaller than the size recommend to work properly with the machine. The next problem is with the audio quality and microphone... I have never, ever, been able to clearly talk into my smartphone and have the audio come out clearly on the device itself. The audio is always choppy and broken, and id be lucky if i could even get a sentence to be clearly heard on the other end. The audio quality of the stream is also very poor as i can barely hear the radio i always leave on for my dog and its literally a couple meters away. The biggest downfall of this device is that it does not swivel, it only sits in one spot and does have a wide angle lens, but it cannot be panned manually from left to right. The other problem with the camera is the color contrast... I have a black dog and burgundy couches, and it takes a trained eye to make out his outline on the couch during broad daylight even with lights on in the house. Want to hear the worst part about this product? Its the service. I bought this device two years ago for my wife on her birthday, because it gives us peace of mind to know our dog is safe while we are at work. Since the begining all of the services the app offered were free, but then all of a sudden about a year ago they started reducing the free features that came with it and started charging for a premium subscription, which i still to this day refuse to pay for. Oh, and whats more, the reason i am writing a frustrated review is because every single time i come back to the app a few days after i last logged in it kicks me out, then i enter my username and password correctly and it tells me the information does not match. this occurs on such a regular basis that its absolutely frustrating that its affected my mental health as well. I can never rely on this product or service to give me the peace of mind to actually know that my dog is safe and sound, and i dont need to worry. Two years after buying, coming from a guy who never writes reviews, there you have it, thats what i think about this inferior product and service. I would have been better off just buying a cheap wireless camera."

More often then not the app works well, however, sometimes the app takes a long time to load/start up the video or the video become laggy and I can't hear audio. The microphone feature is also very unreliable and sometimes doesn't send the audio through at all or only chunks/distorts my voice - which scares my dog.

This camera eliminated all of that worry for me, I can check on my pooches throughout the day and know they are safe and sound.My only criticism would be that they need to create a website you can stream from.

Success!My dog barks after I leave...and it stresses me out when I’m not home. Sometimes she completely quiet, other days she might bark for two hours. I live in a condo so there may be a sound that gets her going. That is why I bought this product. So I get bark alerts and see what she’s up to.It was really easy to start up, it connected to my WiFi easily (I called my wireless company to make sure I had the right setting my WiFi was ready to go)!The video is AMAZING! I live in a small condo and it gives a view of almost the entire living space. It’s a very broad view.It appears to be well made. It’s attractive too so if you worry about how it will look with your decor it’s a nice looking object.The problem is- Daisy is afraid of the clicking and popping noise the treat thrower makes! Lol! So I won’t be able to throw her treats. That would stress her out more!Overall I’m very happy with it so far. And the bark alert will be so helpful. It was worth the money to decrease my stress level. I can’t have her barking- I couldn’t keep her if she did! I hope this is the solution. And it’s just as well about her being afraid of the treat throwing part of the machine. She’s part Beagle. She’d sit in one spot staring at it if she knew food would spit out regularly.  😀"

Could use some upgrades, the first retail iteration is brilliant.",3.0,"Firstly, this is a great idea and product. The quality of the packaging makes a customer feel like they are getting value on an item that is actually quite expensive. The touch of wood on the lid was also a touch that exemplifies quality. Also, I was initially concerned at how much of the room the camera would capture and was pleasantly surprised to see that it captured even more than I expected. At the same time, I was a little disappointed that you could not pan around with the camera. Are there positives about the camera would be: good treat capacity , nice streamlined look good quality daytime and nighttime, seems to have the ability to distinguish between different types of behaviours fairly accurately, and finally the ability to communicate with your pet is for sure an asset. On the negative side, we were continuously having problems with connectivity, but for whatever reason it seems to be under control now. Also negatively, it would be nice to be able to vary the arc or distance in which you launch the treats. We have three dogs and as soon as the smartest one figures out where the treats are going he blocks the others from getting a treat. This could be fixed with either the ability to rotate the camera or machine as well as change the arc or the distance that you throw the treat. A small negative also would be for our dogs once they figured out there was treats coming from this machine they attacked it and emptied it. Thankfully we were able to put it on a very high ledge and still managed to capture a good picture."

The camera is good but a 360 view would be better. However as soon as you’re set up you’re inundated with pop ups from Furbo.The first is prompting you to rate the app before you’ve even had a chance to use your Furbo and you cannot rate it later - you must enter a rating before opening the camera. How can one rate a product they haven’t had a chance to use?Next you’re continually prompted to upgrade/subscribe/spend more money on Furbo Nanny services. We would like to be able to open the app to just view our dog please.I contacted Furbo about turning off the pop ups and it took them 16 days to reply. Yes - sixteen days. It seemed like a form response but since my issue hasn’t been resolved I answered their questions and received the exact same form response again.Not worth it.

"Furbo Dog Camera: Treat Tossing, Full HD WiFi Pet Camera and 2-Way Audio, Designed for Dogs, Compatible with Alexa (As Seen On Ellen)","Reviewed in Canada on July 24, 2020",This thing saved my dogs life,5.0,"This thing is worth every penny.Bought it because my very sweet 6 month old husky mix baby girl has decided that she no longer enjoys being in her crate and instead will bark a heck ton while I am away at work. It’s a full detached home but she can be heard barking away by passerby’s, so I figured I’d see what all the fuss is about and try to put an end to whatever is causing the upset.Set it up this morning (super easy, took me two minutes). Put pup in crate and rolled out. Immediately got a bark notification so, in true helicopter mom mode, I turned the video feed on and left it running as I worked away at my desk. Next hour and a half was a constant cycle of barking, pacing, and short naps. Then, she amped up her unhappiness and began tossing her weight around.Important to note, I moved her crate last night; due to some renovations that are happening in the house, her original location no longer works. Moved the crate so it ended up being next to tiling supplies, which are being installed next week. Made sure the bag of grout was upright and out of reach, no big deal.Anyway, turns out that she’s able to move her crate when she’s bumping all 45lbs of her around. Managed to scoot it up to the pile of tiles, on which the bag of grout (the out of reach one) was perched on. I watched in horror as she hit the tile so perfectly that it knocked over the bag of grout. She then stuck her little face far enough through the crate that she could bite the corner of the bag, ripping it open and dumping a considerable pile of powder into her crate.Half a second later I’m running out of the office and racing home (about ten minutes away), yelling at my precious dumb dumb to please stop. She’s very curious, so immediately started trying to figure out where my voice was coming from which distracted her long enough for me to burst through the door of the house.For those that do not know, the cement in grout is extremely corrosive and very very bad for the insides. So we sped our way to the vet where she was promptly treated and will likely make a full recovery. Vomited up an alarming amount of grout and has to take medication for the next week, but she’s basically fine.Here’s what’s up: this all happened around 10am - I get home for lunch at 12:10. If I didn’t have the Furbo and it didn’t work exactly as advertised, I would have arrived home to a dead or dying dog.Get it. It works."

There was an error the first try, but it worked after that. The first few days of using this dog camera, it lagged A LOT. However, for the most part now - it's been great. I don't really use the treat dispenser because I have 2 dogs. Sometimes it releases no treats, sometimes 1 treat and sometimes 2 treats. I saw a few reviewers that said they got a treat sample, but I did not get any samples. I love the barking feature, where if your dog barks, it alerts you."

They bark a lot more than we thought they did, so we get alerts every time. We can talk to them through the mic and tell them to stop it which freaks them out a bit and they stop. Giving them treats while we're away is cool too. We love the wide-angle view and that we can check in on them anytime. Would definitely recommend to those who work all day and miss their pups."

The camera works great, with several resolutions to choose from. The incoming sound quality is also good. The feature to speak to your pet via the Furbo is less well developed and comes out choppy and unrecognizable.The treat throwing feature has not been useful. It takes only tiny treats, and makes quite a loud noise when ejecting them (my dog is afraid of the sound and will not eat the treats that come out of it due to the sound).The Furbo fails to connect regularly despite a reliable Wi-Fi connection."

Furbo also sends notifications to my phone when my dogs are barking, getting active, or if it sees people. If my smoke or carbon monoxide detector goes off, it will also notify me (which is something I was always worrying about before). Every dog parent needs a Furbo.

"Furbo Dog Camera: Treat Tossing, Full HD WiFi Pet Camera and 2-Way Audio, Designed for Dogs, Compatible with Alexa (As Seen On Ellen)","Reviewed in Canada on May 31, 2019",Fly On the Wall,5.0,"I've only had this product for a week and I think it's great. A lot of reviews said they're having issues with the software but I haven't had any yet, and the complaints about too-frequent notifications seems unfounded as you can turn them off (outside of the application) any time. What I like most about the product is it gives you a ""fly on the wall"" perspective of your dogs behavior and possible anxiety when you're not around, and allows you to reach out to them to curb it as you see fit.It's also eye opening in how bored your K9 likely is all the time when you're not around. It's guilt tripped me into making more of an effort to be attentive whenever I have the opportunity to be with my four legged friend when I'm not working.Good product, good purchase. Only continuous improvement recommendation I have would be to allow users to set the video capture length parameters to whatever they want - barking seems to be set at 15s and activity at 10s, etc. It would be nice to set those yourself, but certainly not a dealbreaker :) well done Furbo."

I’ve had it for a month or so and he likes it too because he’s figured out if he behaves and doesn’t bark he’ll get treats and sometimes I’ll talk to him if i feel he needs some extra love & reinforcement that he’s ok by himself. I have a shichon ( shitzu / bischon frise ) and he’s only 7 lbs so I worry because he’s so small that he might get into something he’s not supposed to. The great part of furbo is I can see exactly what he’s up to and when I watch my videos back at the end of the day I can see what went on. Luckily my puppy doesn’t do much except wait til we get home. None of us work outside the home so he’s very lucky to have someone with him basically all the time so we were worried about him be anxious or having  attachment anxiety when we leave him in the laundry room , with the Furbo whenever we go out and can’t take him with us. I love that I know what’s going on at all times and the bark or active alerts are great for checking in on him. I 100% recommend this for any dog owner. It’s just like having a baby camera /monitor but instead it’s for your dog and you get to reward his good behaviour with treats that you get to toss to him when you’re not home. Genius invention!! I love my Furbo and love my  puppy even more so I’ll do anything to help make his life easier and happier and Furbo has really helped that. Go buy one now!! You’ll thank me later"
